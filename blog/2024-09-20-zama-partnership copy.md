Let’s redefine how Bitcoin works—private and secure, just as it should be
<!--truncate-->


## Encifher and Zama partner to revolutionize Bitcoin

Privacy and security have never been more crucial in a world increasingly reliant on digital transactions. While lauded for its decentralization and transparency, Bitcoin has historically struggled with balancing privacy over user transactions. Encifher is changing that by partnering with Zama, a pioneering leader in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), to introduce unprecedented security and privacy to Bitcoin.

This partnership marks a significant step forward, not only for Bitcoin privacy but also for how we approach data security in decentralized systems. Here’s how Encifher and Zama are working together to shape the future of Bitcoin, making it more 
secure, private, and adaptable to real-world needs.

## The Power of FHE

FHE, the cutting-edge technology at the heart of this partnership, allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decryption. This breakthrough addresses one of the most persistent challenges in the cryptocurrency space: maintaining privacy while ensuring the integrity and verifiability of transactions.
Rand Hindi, CEO and Co-Founder of Zama explains, "FHE is not just an incremental improvement; it's a paradigm shift in how we approach data privacy and security in blockchain. With our technology, Encifher can offer Bitcoin users a level of confidentiality that was previously thought impossible without sacrificing the transparency and auditability that makes Bitcoin so powerful."

## About Zama

Zama is an open source cryptography company that builds state-of-the-art FHE solutions for blockchain and AI. Their technology enables a broad range of privacy-preserving use cases, from confidential smart contracts to encrypted machine learning and privacy-preserving cloud applications.

## Enhancing Bitcoin's Privacy and Security

Bitcoin remains the most valuable digital asset, but its DeFi ecosystem is fragmented, lacking unified solutions like Ethereum. The Taproot upgrade enhanced Bitcoin’s ability to support smart contracts, but privacy and usability issues still deter mass adoption.
Encifher is changing that by offering a comprehensive, trustless, and privacy-first DeFi platform for Bitcoin. Encifher aggregates fragmented DeFi services, ensuring seamless, private, and secure experiences for users, from individual traders to institutions. With programmable privacy and protection against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), Encifher provides the privacy and security needed for DeFi to thrive on Bitcoin.

The partnership between Encifher and Zama brings a groundbreaking level of privacy and security to DeFi. By integrating Zama's FHE technology, they’re creating a seamless, privacy-first DeFi experience on Bitcoin. This collaboration sets a new standard for trust and security, paving the way for a more private and secure future in blockchain technology.
