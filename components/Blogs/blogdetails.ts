                content: "The ERC-20 standard relies on a mapping that tracks the balance of each user. In its conventional form, the state of this mapping is publicly visible on the blockchain, exposing the amount held by every address. This mapping is defined as:\n\n```solidity\nmapping(address => uint256) balanceOf;\n```\n\nEncrypted ERC-20 tokens extend this concept by modifying the mapping to store encrypted balances. Instead of plain integers, the mapping points to encrypted values, represented as:\n\n```solidity\nmapping(address => euint256) balanceOf;\n```\n\nHere, `euint256` represents an encrypted integer type, ensuring that the balance of a user is not directly visible on the public blockchain. Despite this fundamental change, the token retains all functional properties of a standard ERC-20 token: it can be minted, transferred, and burned.\n\nThe key distinction is that the values involved in these operations—such as the number of tokens minted, transferred, or burned—are not exposed to the blockchain’s public ledger. This ensures transactional privacy while maintaining the token’s compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem."

                header: "How does encryption take place?",
                content: "The primary question when implementing encrypted ERC-20 tokens is how the amount is encrypted and how balances are updated while ensuring privacy. This is achieved through Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). These technologies enable **Programmable Privacy**, allowing operations on encrypted values without decrypting them.\n\nSince computations on encrypted data cannot occur on-chain due to current blockchain limitations, an off-chain PET co-processor performs these operations. The co-processor handles encrypted inputs, performs necessary calculations (such as addition or multiplication), and updates the on-chain state with the computed encrypted results. This approach ensures that all sensitive data remains private while maintaining the integrity of on-chain records.\n\n![d4a1e6fa-839b-4189-8468-c6be6dc4d6db.png](/snippet1.webp)\n\nThe computation relies on homomorphic operations, which allow encrypted values to be composed with one another. For example, an encrypted balance can be updated by adding an encrypted transfer amount, producing a new encrypted balance without exposing the underlying values. This mechanism creates what is known as a **Private Shared State**, where encrypted values can be used alongside public values for secure operations.\n\nThe encryption process begins at the client end. The client encrypts the transfer amount using the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. Both the client and the co-processor generate private keys and exchange public keys to derive a shared secret key. This shared key is then used for the AES encryption of the ERC-20 token value.\n\nThe encrypted value is passed to the co-processor, which performs the necessary computations and updates the on-chain mapping. For example, when a transfer is initiated:\n\n1. The sender's encrypted balance is decremented by the encrypted amount.\n2. The recipient's encrypted balance is incremented by the same encrypted amount.\n\nThese updates ensure that the balances reflect the transaction without exposing the transferred amount or the parties involved. This design leverages PETs to maintain privacy while enabling secure and verifiable token operations."

                header: "Architecture",
                content: "Encrypted ERC20 tokens are designed as a 1:1 representation of original ERC20 tokens. The process begins when a user deposits standard ERC20 tokens into a **wrapper contract**, which locks the tokens and mints an equivalent amount of Encrypted ERC20 tokens. This ensures that for every token locked in the wrapper contract, a corresponding encrypted token exists in circulation.\n\n![4280423f-74bb-48e2-bb38-02edbdb4521f.png](/snippet2.png)\n\nInitially, the balance of a user in the encrypted token system mirrors their deposit, but it is stored in an encrypted form. For example, if a user deposits 321 tokens, their balance might be represented as an encrypted value such as:\n\n```javascript\ne0dce70a03a10845f75e61265bf86cfc7fe58e98818f93378f1a508b3e0c29340e822d4b8563074f8c7506de5814a6a7\n```\n\nThis encrypted balance is dynamic and changes even when no tokens are transferred. For instance, after a zero-token transaction, the same balance could update to a new encrypted value, such as:\n\n```javascript\nb067af5b5e7c56d6240bcba3a4fdf0a61e0fe9a4c6492185eb01a1cd16e59da03ecf97e6d1f8c28defaeb555b5738ad1\n```\n\nThis property ensures that balances cannot be inferred or linked to specific transactions, preserving privacy even in scenarios where the transferred amount is zero. Similarly, non-zero transfers also result in entirely new encrypted representations, preventing the tracking of balances across transactions.\n\nA crucial component of the architecture is the use of **access controllers**. These controllers define permissions for accessing and interacting with encrypted data. They ensure that only authorized entities, such as designated users or smart contracts, can decrypt or utilize encrypted values in their calculations. This access control mechanism maintains the confidentiality of sensitive data while enabling controlled interoperability with other on-chain systems.\n\nTo redeem the original tokens, users can deposit their Encrypted ERC20 tokens back into the wrapper contract. Upon verification, the contract burns the encrypted tokens and releases the equivalent amount of original ERC20 tokens, ensuring a seamless transition between the encrypted and standard token systems."

It provides an immutable and verifiable record of balances, token ownership, smart contract data, and other critical elements of the blockchain ecosystem. For example, the state indicates how much tokens a particular account holds or the logic governing a smart contract at any point in time. This shared state enables participants to operate with confidence, as the system ensures consistency and prevents fraudulent transactions.\n\nIn blockchain systems, the state is shared among participants in a decentralized manner. All users and nodes in the network have access to the current state and can propose changes through new transactions."

The 'content' of the whiteboard represents the state of the blockchain at a given time. Anyone can propose changes, but the decentralized network ensures these changes are valid before they are permanently added to the whiteboard. This transparency and openness underpin the trust and functionality of blockchain systems.\n\nShared state, while foundational to blockchain technology, introduces specific challenges, particularly regarding privacy, scalability, and security. These challenges become more pronounced as the adoption of blockchain applications grows and the volume of data on the shared state increases. Addressing these challenges requires innovations like a private shared state, which combines the benefits of decentralization with enhanced data confidentiality."

                content: "The shared state on blockchain serves as a global resource accessible to all dApps operating on the network. This design enables composability, where different applications can interact seamlessly by leveraging each other's states. For instance, a staking application may integrate with AAVE to manage funds and enable more complex functionality. This cross-application access to state drives innovation but also introduces significant challenges, particularly around privacy and security.\n\nA key issue arises when certain states hold sensitive or high-value information that should not be publicly visible. For example, consider the token balance of a corporate treasury or a strategic asset position managed by a DAO. If such information is freely accessible, it creates vulnerabilities. Adversaries can monitor and analyze this data to exploit it for financial or strategic gains.\n\nThe problem extends beyond the visibility of static data. On a blockchain, not only is the current state visible, but also the patterns of interaction with that state. For instance, a user interacting with a trading application leaves behind a visible sequence of transactions, which reveals behavioral patterns such as trading strategies or investment decisions. This lack of privacy exposes users to front-running, copy trading, and other forms of exploitation.\n\nMoreover, when a state with high-value data resides on-chain, it attracts attention from bots, trackers, and malicious actors. Large token balances or frequently used addresses become focal points for automated systems designed to monitor and mimic their actions. The lack of confidentiality not only undermines user security but also introduces inefficiencies and risks in decentralized systems.\n\nThese challenges necessitate solutions that allow for composability and transparency while preserving the privacy of sensitive state data and interaction patterns. Private shared state is one such approach, providing a framework for secure and confidential on-chain interactions without compromising the benefits of decentralization."

In this paradigm, while public states remain accessible and composable as they are today, private states would introduce confidentiality by restricting visibility and access to sensitive information. ![pss.png](/pss.png)  \n\nHowever, integrating private states with public states presents a fundamental challenge: composability. Computations involving private states cannot natively interact with public states in the same way traditional blockchain computations do. To address this, computations on private states need to occur off-chain within a secure environment, such as a ZK circuit or a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). These secure environments generate cryptographic proofs or attestations that validate the computation's correctness without revealing the underlying data.\n\nPrivate states can also be designed to be shared selectively between participants, allowing individual addresses to compute on them independently and produce a new state. This capability enables consensus to be reached on private data without exposing sensitive details. Moreover, by enabling public states to read or modify themselves conditionally based on private states (with appropriate permissions), new application models can emerge. For example, dApps could define mechanisms that allow users to monetize their data securely by granting limited access to private states."

While it’s been a store of value for many, the vast reserves of Bitcoin on Layer 1 remain largely frozen, unable to participate in the dynamic world of decentralized finance or generate yields. Efforts like Babylon are chipping away at this ice, but the challenge remains: Bitcoin’s true power is yet to be fully realized. Some of the original Bitcoin purists—OGs—may argue that Bitcoin should remain unchanged, preserving its foundational simplicity. Yet, history has shown us that any currency, to thrive, must evolve and be widely adopted. This has been the case for the U.S. dollar, which became a global reserve currency through widespread use and trust. Bitcoin now finds itself at a similar crossroads. As governments and financial giants recognize Bitcoin's potential, ETFs are being created to give them exposure to this asset class. Yet, despite this increasing institutional interest, there’s one crucial roadblock: they can’t hold or trade it directly."

    //             content: "As Bitcoin reaches this critical inflection point, the interest from institutional players—governments, financial institutions, and corporations—is unmistakable. They see the potential for Bitcoin to become a global asset, but there’s a significant hurdle in their path: privacy. In a world where data has become the new oil, institutions must tread carefully. The very feature that gives Bitcoin its strength—transparency—also becomes its Achilles' heel. While blockchain transparency promotes trust and enables verification, it exposes every transaction to the public eye. For large corporations, this means that sensitive financial movements, supply chain data, or strategic business decisions could be laid bare for competitors to analyze. A 2022 PwC survey highlighted that 55% of businesses are hesitant to adopt Bitcoin because of these concerns. The fear isn't unfounded—imagine a global supply chain where every payment could be traced, revealing strategic partnerships or pricing models. In the hands of competitors or malicious actors, this could become a significant risk. As powerful as Bitcoin’s decentralized transparency is, it inadvertently invites surveillance and competitive exposure. In today’s digital economy, the value of privacy has never been greater. Institutions, particularly those with vast amounts of capital and sensitive operations, can’t afford to take risks with their data. This dilemma creates a tension—Bitcoin’s path forward requires a balance between its decentralized transparency and the privacy protections that institutional players demand. The challenge is clear: if Bitcoin is to move beyond its current use case and unlock the trillions in institutional capital waiting on the sidelines, privacy is no longer optional—it’s essential."

    //             content: "While institutional players face the privacy dilemma from a corporate and competitive standpoint, retail users are confronted with a different yet equally pressing challenge: personal safety and financial security. These everyday Bitcoin users may not be bound by the same heavy regulations as institutions, but the risks they face are no less daunting. For the average retail user, the transparent nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain can feel like a double-edged sword. While Bitcoin offers freedom from traditional banking systems, that freedom comes at a cost—visibility. When a user’s identity becomes linked to their Bitcoin address, they become vulnerable to targeted phishing attacks, scams, and even worse, social engineering attacks designed to exploit their financial data. The numbers paint a stark picture. Over the last two years, reports show a 200% increase in these types of attacks. According to Chainalysis, cryptocurrency-related crime hit an all-time high of $14 billion in 2021, with a significant portion involving thefts targeting users with visible Bitcoin holdings. These attacks don’t just harm individuals; they create an atmosphere of fear that undermines trust in the broader ecosystem. This fear has a profound economic impact. When users feel they are being watched, they’re less likely to participate fully in the Bitcoin economy. A study from the Journal of Cybersecurity highlights how perceived risks of surveillance discourage people from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. This reluctance stifles innovation, reduces liquidity, and limits Bitcoin’s potential as a widely adopted currency. As Bitcoin’s market capitalization surpasses $1 trillion, trust in its privacy and security systems becomes paramount. Retail users need to feel secure not only in their transactions but also in their anonymity. Privacy breaches could shake user confidence and lead to market instability. Yet, the common concern that enhanced privacy would enable illicit activities doesn’t hold water—data suggests that less than 1% of total cryptocurrency transactions involve illicit activity. This indicates that strict regulations targeting privacy tools might harm legitimate users far more than they deter criminals. In this way, both institutional players and retail users face the same underlying issue—Bitcoin’s transparency, while one of its core strengths, can also be a liability. For Bitcoin to truly grow and reach mass adoption, privacy needs to be part of the equation. Just as institutions are demanding it for protection from competitive risks, retail users need it to safeguard their personal financial well-being."

    //             content: "As the need for privacy in both institutional and retail spaces becomes increasingly clear, it’s no surprise that many attempts have been made to bring privacy solutions to Bitcoin. Over the years, we’ve seen the rise of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash, which were built specifically to address the demand for anonymous transactions. Monero alone has reached a market cap of over $3 billion, a testament to how many users prioritize privacy in their financial dealings. This demand has also been reflected within the Bitcoin ecosystem, where tools like CoinJoin have seen growing adoption. Wasabi Wallet, a leader in CoinJoin techniques, reported over 1 million transactions processed through their platform by 2022, signaling that users are increasingly aware of, and demanding, enhanced privacy measures. However, while these solutions point to the right direction, they’ve struggled to gain mainstream adoption. Why? Because most of them either operate in a non-compliant manner or offer a terrible user experience. Take CoinJoin, for instance. Despite its privacy advantages, it often requires users to navigate technical complexities, creating friction that deters everyday Bitcoin users. On top of that, many privacy-enhancing solutions have faced significant legal hurdles. Regulatory bodies around the world are cracking down on tools they view as potential enablers of illicit activity, citing AML and KYC violations as major concerns. But there’s a pattern to innovation—technology evolves in cycles. First comes the rush of excitement, then the inevitable correction, and finally, a period of real, thoughtful building. Privacy solutions for Bitcoin are no different. The initial rush brought attention to privacy issues, but also exposed the need for compliant, user-friendly tools that can navigate both the regulatory landscape and user expectations. At Encifher, we believe privacy isn’t just a niche concern; it’s foundational to Bitcoin’s future in the global economy. Just as decentralized finance (DeFi) has disrupted traditional banking systems, privacy on the world’s most secure blockchain could be the key to unlocking a new era of financial autonomy. We envision a future where Bitcoin’s liquidity grows as its privacy features improve—attracting more participants, deepening markets, and creating opportunities for everything from lending to staking. The question isn’t whether privacy is needed—it’s how to make it accessible and compliant. Previous solutions have laid the groundwork, showing us the potential but also highlighting the gaps. For Bitcoin to become the trusted, private asset the world needs, privacy tools must strike a delicate balance between regulatory compliance and ease of use—something the ecosystem has struggled with so far."

These actions highlight a deep tension between privacy and compliance. Users of these services risk unintentional legal violations, while developers face prosecution for creating privacy solutions. This creates a chilling effect on innovation, stifling the development of much-needed privacy mechanisms in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Moreover, the complexity of existing tools like CoinJoin, coupled with regulatory pressures, has left retail users struggling with steep learning curves and clunky interfaces. For Bitcoin to evolve, privacy must not only be compliant but accessible. Simplifying the user experience while ensuring adherence to regulations is critical. That’s where Encifher comes in."
