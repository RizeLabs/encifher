The key idea is that PRSS eliminates the need for explicit communication during share generation, as participants independently compute their shares using the same PRF/PRG.\n\nMathematically, if $f_k(x)$ is a PRF with a shared key $k$, the shares are $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ and they are computed as:\n\n$$ s_i = f_k(i), \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} $$\n\nThe secret $S$ can then be reconstructed by summing the shares:\n\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i \\mod p $$\n\nwhere $p$ is a large prime.",

For example, the state indicates how much tokens a particular account holds or the logic governing a smart contract at any point in time. This shared state enables participants to operate with confidence, as the system ensures consistency and prevents fraudulent transactions.\n\nIn blockchain systems, the state is shared among participants in a decentralized manner. All users and nodes in the network have access to the current state and can propose changes through new transactions.",

The 'content' of the whiteboard represents the state of the blockchain at a given time. Anyone can propose changes, but the decentralized network ensures these changes are valid before they are permanently added to the whiteboard. This transparency and openness underpin the trust and functionality of blockchain systems.\n\nShared state, while foundational to blockchain technology, introduces specific challenges, particularly regarding privacy, scalability, and security. These challenges become more pronounced as the adoption of blockchain applications grows and the volume of data on the shared state increases. Addressing these challenges requires innovations like a private shared state, which combines the benefits of decentralization with enhanced data confidentiality.",

          content:
            "The shared state on blockchain serves as a global resource accessible to all dApps operating on the network. This design enables composability, where different applications can interact seamlessly by leveraging each other's states. For instance, a staking application may integrate with AAVE to manage funds and enable more complex functionality. This cross-application access to state drives innovation but also introduces significant challenges, particularly around privacy and security.\n\nA key issue arises when certain states hold sensitive or high-value information that should not be publicly visible. For example, consider the token balance of a corporate treasury or a strategic asset position managed by a DAO. If such information is freely accessible, it creates vulnerabilities. Adversaries can monitor and analyze this data to exploit it for financial or strategic gains.\n\nThe problem extends beyond the visibility of static data. On a blockchain, not only is the current state visible, but also the patterns of interaction with that state. For instance, a user interacting with a trading application leaves behind a visible sequence of transactions, which reveals behavioral patterns such as trading strategies or investment decisions. This lack of privacy exposes users to front-running, copy trading, and other forms of exploitation.\n\nMoreover, when a state with high-value data resides on-chain, it attracts attention from bots, trackers, and malicious actors. Large token balances or frequently used addresses become focal points for automated systems designed to monitor and mimic their actions. The lack of confidentiality not only undermines user security but also introduces inefficiencies and risks in decentralized systems.\n\nThese challenges necessitate solutions that allow for composability and transparency while preserving the privacy of sensitive state data and interaction patterns. Private shared state is one such approach, providing a framework for secure and confidential on-chain interactions without compromising the benefits of decentralization.",

In this paradigm, while public states remain accessible and composable as they are today, private states would introduce confidentiality by restricting visibility and access to sensitive information. ![pss.png](/pss.png)  \n\nHowever, integrating private states with public states presents a fundamental challenge: composability. Computations involving private states cannot natively interact with public states in the same way traditional blockchain computations do. To address this, computations on private states need to occur off-chain within a secure environment, such as a ZK circuit or a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). These secure environments generate cryptographic proofs or attestations that validate the computation's correctness without revealing the underlying data.\n\nPrivate states can also be designed to be shared selectively between participants, allowing individual addresses to compute on them independently and produce a new state. This capability enables consensus to be reached on private data without exposing sensitive details. Moreover, by enabling public states to read or modify themselves conditionally based on private states (with appropriate permissions), new application models can emerge. For example, dApps could define mechanisms that allow users to monetize their data securely by granting limited access to private states.",

Instead of plain integers, the mapping points to encrypted values, represented as:\n\n```solidity\nmapping(address => euint256) balanceOf;\n```\n\nHere, `euint256` represents an encrypted integer type, ensuring that the balance of a user is not directly visible on the public blockchain. Despite this fundamental change, the token retains all functional properties of a standard ERC-20 token: it can be minted, transferred, and burned.\n\nThe key distinction is that the values involved in these operations—such as the number of tokens minted, transferred, or burned—are not exposed to the blockchain’s public ledger.

          content:
            "The primary question when implementing encrypted ERC-20 tokens is how the amount is encrypted and how balances are updated while ensuring privacy. This is achieved through Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). These technologies enable **Programmable Privacy**, allowing operations on encrypted values without decrypting them.\n\nSince computations on encrypted data cannot occur on-chain due to current blockchain limitations, an off-chain PET co-processor performs these operations. The co-processor handles encrypted inputs, performs necessary calculations (such as addition or multiplication), and updates the on-chain state with the computed encrypted results. This approach ensures that all sensitive data remains private while maintaining the integrity of on-chain records.\n\n![d4a1e6fa-839b-4189-8468-c6be6dc4d6db.png](/snippet1.webp)\n\nThe computation relies on homomorphic operations, which allow encrypted values to be composed with one another. For example, an encrypted balance can be updated by adding an encrypted transfer amount, producing a new encrypted balance without exposing the underlying values. This mechanism creates what is known as a **Private Shared State**, where encrypted values can be used alongside public values for secure operations.\n\nThe encryption process begins at the client end. The client encrypts the transfer amount using the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. Both the client and the co-processor generate private keys and exchange public keys to derive a shared secret key. This shared key is then used for the AES encryption of the ERC-20 token value.\n\nThe encrypted value is passed to the co-processor, which performs the necessary computations and updates the on-chain mapping. For example, when a transfer is initiated:\n\n1. The sender's encrypted balance is decremented by the encrypted amount.\n2. The recipient's encrypted balance is incremented by the same encrypted amount.\n\nThese updates ensure that the balances reflect the transaction without exposing the transferred amount or the parties involved.

            "Encrypted ERC20 tokens are designed as a 1:1 representation of original ERC20 tokens. The process begins when a user deposits standard ERC20 tokens into a **wrapper contract**, which locks the tokens and mints an equivalent amount of Encrypted ERC20 tokens. This ensures that for every token locked in the wrapper contract, a corresponding encrypted token exists in circulation.\n\n![4280423f-74bb-48e2-bb38-02edbdb4521f.png](/snippet2.png)\n\nInitially, the balance of a user in the encrypted token system mirrors their deposit, but it is stored in an encrypted form. For example, if a user deposits 321 tokens, their balance might be represented as an encrypted value such as:\n\n```javascript\ne0dce70a03a10845f75e61265bf86cfc7fe58e98818f93378f1a508b3e0c29340e822d4b8563074f8c7506de5814a6a7\n```\n\nThis encrypted balance is dynamic and changes even when no tokens are transferred. For instance, after a zero-token transaction, the same balance could update to a new encrypted value, such as:\n\n```javascript\nb067af5b5e7c56d6240bcba3a4fdf0a61e0fe9a4c6492185eb01a1cd16e59da03ecf97e6d1f8c28defaeb555b5738ad1\n```\n\nThis property ensures that balances cannot be inferred or linked to specific transactions, preserving privacy even in scenarios where the transferred amount is zero. Similarly, non-zero transfers also result in entirely new encrypted representations, preventing the tracking of balances across transactions.\n\nA crucial component of the architecture is the use of **access controllers**. These controllers define permissions for accessing and interacting with encrypted data. They ensure that only authorized entities, such as designated users or smart contracts, can decrypt or utilize encrypted values in their calculations. This access control mechanism maintains the confidentiality of sensitive data while enabling controlled interoperability with other on-chain systems.\n\nTo redeem the original tokens, users can deposit their Encrypted ERC20 tokens back into the wrapper contract. Upon verification, the contract burns the encrypted tokens and releases the equivalent amount of original ERC20 tokens, ensuring a seamless transition between the encrypted and standard token systems.",

          content:
            "Encrypted ERC20 tokens extend the ERC20 standard by introducing privacy-preserving mechanisms through encryption. By leveraging wrapper contracts, Privacy Enhancing Technologies, and dynamic encrypted representations, they enable secure token transfers without exposing balances or transaction details. The architecture ensures 1:1 parity with original tokens while maintaining compatibility with existing blockchain infrastructure.\n\nThis design combines cryptographic rigor with practical usability, creating a framework for private yet verifiable token transactions. Encrypted ERC20 tokens represent a step toward programmable privacy, balancing confidentiality and transparency in decentralized systems.",
